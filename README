## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to problems encountered in different contexts. Whether it's competitive programming challenges, coding interview questions, or personal projects, I document my problem-solving journey here.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into different directories based on problem categories or platforms. Here's an overview of the directory structure:

```
- /Algorithms
  - /Sorting
  - /Searching
  - /DynamicProgramming
  - ...
- /DataStructures
  - /Arrays
  - /LinkedLists
  - /Trees
  - ...
- /LeetCode
- /HackerRank
- /Codeforces
- /ProjectEuler
- ...
```

## How to Use

Each directory contains solutions to specific problems or sets of problems. Inside each problem directory, you'll typically find:

- Source code files (e.g., `.cpp`, `.java`, `.py`) with solution implementations.
- A `README.md` file providing problem description, solution explanation, and any additional notes.

Feel free to navigate through the directories to find solutions that interest you. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request!

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that's not already covered in this repository, feel free to contribute. Here's how you can do it:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-solution`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add solution to problem XYZ'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-solution`).
5. Submit a pull request.
